package elyland.cachemap;

/**
 * A generic cache. Works just like a Map, except that entries automatically "disappear"
 * when they expire. <p>
 *
 * For example, if you have a bunch of persons in a database or external system,
 * and you have a corresponding Person class with id of type Long, you can create a cache
 * with 60-second expiry like this: <p>
 * <pre>
 * CacheMap&lt;Long, Person&gt; cache = new CacheMapImpl&lt;Long, Person&gt;();
 * cache.setTimeToLive(60000);
 * </pre>
 *
 * Your code for fetching a person by id would look something like this: <p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * Person person = cache.get(personId);
 * if (person == null) {
 *   person = slowSystemThatShouldntBeUsedTooOften.getPerson(personId);
 *   cache.put(personId, person);
 * }
 * return person;
 * </pre>
 *
 * Additional notes: <br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * 	Implementations do not have to be thread-safe.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  No methods should ever return or count any entries that have expired.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  Implementations do not have to clear expired entries automatically
 *  as soon as they expire.
 *  It is OK to clean up expired entries in conjunction with method calls instead.
 *  From the outside, however, it should look like entries disappear as soon as they
 *  get expired.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  For unit-testing purposes, this class should get the current time using
 *  the Clock class, not System.currentTimeMillis(). That way unit tests can override the
 *  time.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *
